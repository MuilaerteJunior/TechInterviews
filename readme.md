# TechInterviews

This repository was created based on code challenges from tech interviews.

Feel free to contribute, discuss and enumerate any discussion that you may be relevant!

Summary: 
   1. **VTEX**: From two strings, how to check if there is any character that repeat in both strings.
   2. **Amazon**: From a sequence of numbers representing a stock value, how to identify which buy/sell would make the highest profit.


*In my very personal opinion, I don't agree with this kind of challenges while recruiting any professional, mostly, because it's not how real life happens.*
